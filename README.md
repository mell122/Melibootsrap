# Project Documentation

## Tools Used

1. **Programming Language:**
   - Python (for scripting and application development)
   - YAML (for configuration and data representation)

2. **API:**
   - Utilized both GET and POST methods for communication with endpoints.

3. **Continuous Integration (CI):**
   - Integrated CI for automated testing and deployment.

4. **Docker:**
   - Docker was employed to containerize the application.
   - Built a Docker image for consistent and portable deployment.

5. **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
   - Kubernetes: Orchestrated deployment and scaling using Kubernetes.
   - Kubectl: Command-line utility for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.

## Automated Pipeline

The following steps were combined to form an automated pipeline:

1. **Continuous Integration:**
   - Leveraged CI to automate testing and integration processes.

2. **Docker Image Creation:**
   - Utilized Docker to encapsulate the application and its dependencies.
   - Constructed a Docker image for streamlined deployment.

3. **Continuous Deployment with Kubernetes:**
   - Orchestrated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications using Kubernetes.
   - Employed Kubectl for command-line interaction with the Kubernetes cluster.

## Additional Tools

1. **Kind:**
   - Used Kind for creating Kubernetes clusters using Docker containers as nodes for testing and development.

2. **Webhooks:**
   - Implemented webhooks for automating actions in response to events during the CI/CD pipeline.

3. **Draw.io:**
   - Utilized Draw.io for visual representation and documentation of system architecture and design.
